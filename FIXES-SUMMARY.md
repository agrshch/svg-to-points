# Demo Page Fixes

## üîß Fixed Issues

### 1. **Guaranteed preservation of polygon vertices**
- **Problem**: Polygon corners could be "cut off" at low point density
- **Solution**: All vertices (corners) are now ALWAYS included in the result regardless of density
- **Elements**: `polygon`, `polyline`, `rect`

### 2. **Optional closing of closed shapes**
- **Problem**: User wanted to control duplication of the first point at the end
- **Solution**: Added `closePaths: boolean` option
- **Closing logic**:
  - ‚úÖ **Closed** (when `closePaths: true`): `polygon`, `circle`, `ellipse`, `rect`, closed `path` (with Z command)
  - ‚ùå **NOT closed** ever: `polyline`, `line`, open `path`

### 3. **Increased canvas sizes**
- **Problem**: Small canvases made detailed viewing difficult
- **Solution**: 
  - Demo 2: `280√ó160` ‚Üí `500√ó300` pixels
  - File upload: `400√ó300` ‚Üí `600√ó450` pixels

## üé® New visualization features

### 1. **Point display**
- Can see the extracted points themselves as colored circles
- Configurable point size (1-8px)
- Real-time point display toggle

### 2. **Closing control**
- "Close shapes" checkbox in interface
- Instant application of changes
- Visual indication of closure

### 3. **Extended visualization settings**
- Separate control for showing lines and points
- Point size adjustment
- Point density adjustment for uploaded files

## üìã API changes

### New constructor option
```javascript
const extractor = new SVGPathExtractor({
  closePaths: false // Default - don't close (default: false)
});
```

### TypeScript updates
```typescript
interface SVGPathExtractorOptions {
  // ... existing options ...
  
  /**
   * Close closed shapes by duplicating first point at end
   * Applies only to inherently closed shapes: polygon, circle, ellipse, rect, and closed paths (ending with Z/z)
   * @default false
   */
  closePaths?: boolean;
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Created HTML test (`test-vertices.html`)
- Check preservation of rectangle vertices
- Check preservation of polygon vertices  
- Test closing of closed shapes
- Test NON-closing of open shapes
- Visual results with color indication

### Test results
- ‚úÖ All rectangle vertices are preserved
- ‚úÖ All polygon vertices are preserved
- ‚úÖ Polygons close when `closePaths: true`
- ‚úÖ Polylines do NOT close even when `closePaths: true`
- ‚úÖ Closed paths close when `closePaths: true`
- ‚úÖ Open paths do NOT close

## üìÅ Modified files

1. **`svg-path-extractor.js`** - main library
   - Added `closePaths` option
   - Fixed processing logic for all elements
   - Guaranteed vertex preservation

2. **`index.d.ts`** - TypeScript definitions
   - Added new `closePaths` option
   - Updated documentation

3. **`standalone-demo.html`** - demo page
   - Increased canvas sizes
   - Added closing checkboxes
   - Improved point and line visualization
   - Interactive settings

4. **`test-vertices.html`** - test page
   - Automated tests
   - Visual verification of fixes

## üí° Practical benefits

1. **Corner accuracy**: No more "cut off" corners on polygons
2. **Closing control**: User decides whether to duplicate the first point
3. **Better visualization**: Larger canvases + points = more detailed viewing
4. **Flexibility**: Settings apply instantly without reload

## üîç Usage

### Basic usage
```javascript
// Only extraction without closing
const extractor = new SVGPathExtractor();
const paths = await extractor.extractPoints(svgContent);

// With shape closing
const extractorWithClosing = new SVGPathExtractor({ closePaths: true });
const closedPaths = await extractorWithClosing.extractPoints(svgContent);
```

### In demo page
1. Upload SVG file or use built-in examples
2. Enable "Close shapes" if needed
3. Adjust point size and density
4. Toggle point/line display for analysis

All fixes are backward compatible - existing code will work without changes!
